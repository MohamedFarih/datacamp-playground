# Introduction to Data Science

## What is data science?

### Customer segmentation workflow

Stephanie manages a data science team at a subscription-based dog food delivery company. Her team has been asked to investigate loss of customers, also known as customer churn.

- Download the data
- Reformat the delivery date on all entries to be in the same time zone
- Create a line chart that shows decay in subscriptions by cohort
- Cluster the users into different personas and perform a regression to predict churn for each cluster

### Building a customer service chatbot

Ritesh and his data team are working on a customer service chatbot. The chatbot is a computer program that uses data science to answer basic customer questions via a messenger. The team will use transcripts from over 300,000 customer service interactions to train a chatbot to answer customer questions.

- Data collection and storage
  - Load the transcripts into the data team's database
  - Collect the timestamps for each conversation
  - Gather customer information for each conversation
- Exploration and Visualization
  - Create a bar chart of the number of conversation of each type
  - Plot the number of conversation vs. the time of day
- Experimentation and Prediction
  - Use a machine learning model to predict possible responses for each question
  - Create an algorithm that classifiers the initial customer question

## Applcations of data science

### Assigning data science project

Laura manages an analytics team and has a few tasks that she's hoping to achieve this quarter. The tasks are centered around the following domains:

- **traditional machine learning**
- **deep learning**
- **Internet of Things (IoT)**
The knowledge to build traditional machine learning and deep learning applications is present within her team. There is another team in the company that is specialized in working with IoT data. Laura wants to know for which tasks she'll need their help.

- Traditional Machine Learning
  - Predict ride-sharing prices at a certain time and location based on previous prices
  - Cluster patients by symptoms to help doctors select a treatment

- Deep Learning
  - Automatically summarize text from news articles
  - Flag images that contain a saftety violation

- Internet of Things
  - Automate building cooling using temperature sensors
  - Detect machinery failture with vibration detectors

### Investment research

Greg is an investment analyst. He's been asked to review a new start-up that uses easy-to-install vibration sensors to measure the amount of traffic on a bridge or highway. His boss has asked him to do some background research and decide which category this start-up belongs in.

Based on the startup's dashboard shown on the right, which category best fits this start-up?

Possible Answers

- Internet of Things
