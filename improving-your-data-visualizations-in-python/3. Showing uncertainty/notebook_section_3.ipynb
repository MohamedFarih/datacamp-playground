    "You are a data scientist for a fireworks manufacturer in Des Moines, Iowa. You need to make a case to the city that your company's large fireworks show has not caused any harm to the city's air. To do this, you look at the average levels for pollutants in the week after the fourth of July and how they compare to readings taken after your last show. By showing confidence intervals around the averages, you can make a case that the recent readings were well within the normal range.\n",

    "Vandenberg Air Force Base is often used as a location to launch rockets into space. You have a theory that a recent increase in the pace of rocket launches could be harming the air quality in the surrounding region. To explore this, you plotted a 25-day rolling average line of the measurements of atmospheric NO2. To help decide if any pattern observed is random-noise or not, you decide to add a 99% confidence band around your rolling mean. Adding a confidence band to a trend line can help shed light on the stability of the trend seen. This can either increase or decrease the confidence in the discovered trend."
