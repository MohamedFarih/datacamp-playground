You have a theory that a recent increase in the pace of rocket launches could be harming the air quality in the surrounding region. To explore this, you plotted a 25-day rolling average line of the measurements of atmospheric NO2. To help decide if any pattern observed is random-noise or not, you decide to add a 99% confidence band around your rolling mean. Adding a confidence band to a trend line can help shed light on the stability of the trend seen. This can either increase or decrease the confidence in the discovered trend."
