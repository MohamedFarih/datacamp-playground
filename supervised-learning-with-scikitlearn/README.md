## Classification

### Supervised learning

#### What is machine learning?
- The art and science of:
    - Giving computers the ability to learn to make decisions from data
    - Without being explicityly programmed!
- Examples:
    - Learning to predict whether an email is spam or not
    - Clustering wikipedia entries into different categories
- Supervised learning: Uses labeled data
- Unsupervised learning: Uses unlabeled data

#### Unsupervised learning
- Uncovering hidden patterns from unlabeled data

#### Reinforcement learning
- Software agents interact with an environment
    - Learn how to optimize their behavior
    - Given a system of rewards and punishments
    - Draws inspiration from behavioral psychology

- Application
    - Economics
    - Genetics
    - Game
